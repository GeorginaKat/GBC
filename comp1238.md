## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
- Johannes Gutenburg with the press improved and commercialized the printing process (around 1450AD)
- Typeface:the literal face of the type piece, now interchangable with "font"
- Font: pieces of particular size and shape
- Font weight: bold, regular, light
- Type Setting: now describes the process of preparing files (PDFs)
  
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Volatile Memory gets erased when the electricity is turned off (i.e. RAM)
- Non-Volatile Memory is used for long term (i.e. storage or disk)
- The "bit" is short for binary digit.
- A byte consists of 8 bits. 8 bytes= 64 bits.
- Samuel Morse developed the telegragh with physisist Joseph Henry, and Mechanical Engineer, Alfred Vail around 1837
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Units of measurement: Kilo, Mega, Giga
- 1 Megabyte=8 megabits
- Kilo is 1000 or 1024
- Prefix 0b to stress binary ex: 0b1101
- Binary: base 2/0s and 1s
- Octal: base 8/ 0-7
- Decimal: base 10/ 0-9
- Hexadecimal: base 16/ 0-9 and A-F
- ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- "Text Mode": divides the screen into grid, usually 80 columns by 25 lines, putting a chatacter in each cell
- Uni-code UTF-8 for other languages
- Text files are files where each byte is interpeted as a character

- ## Week 3- Text Structure
- Text Structure: Lines (new line), spaces (white space and indentation), paragraghs
- Alphanumeric: characters, letters, and digits
- Non-alpha: everything else
- Markup Proofreading: Well stanadarized set of symbols written by hand to tell the author what needs to be changed
- HTML and WWW were proposed by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN
- HTML: rendered by the browser' flexible; adheres to standards maintained and developed by the W3C and other org.
- Strutured data: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- Both JSON and XML are text-based format used to serialize structured data intended to be read by computer software (still human readable)
- Special Characters and "Escaping": #render titles (special or reserved characters) ##Title
- Escaping other special characters, backslash method (\# means print a literal #)
- UTF-8 requires 1byte (8bits) needed to store an English letter
- Space Key is not a modifier
- IDE: Integrated Development Environment
- Monospaced (fixed-width) is the best font for writing code and ASCII art

  ## Week 4- Working With Text
  - Text Editors: notepad, vi, vscode
  - Word Processors: Microsoft Word
  - Qwerty: common in Germany, Eastern Europe and Portugal
  - Modifier Keys: ^Ctrl (Control); Alt (Alternate); CMD(Command); Win (Windows)
  - Wildcard Characters: a character that will match any character or sequence of characters in a search
  - RegEx: Regular Expressions (.matches and character);[abc] matches any of the listed characters; [a-z] matches any lower case letter;[0-9] matches any digit
  
  ## Week 5- Command Line Interfaces
-Cat, less,: show contents of a text file
-cd: change directory
-pwd: print working directory
-cp, mv, mkdir: copy and move files, create directory
-ping: server on the network
- WSL: Windows Subsystem for Linux
  - SSH: Secure Shell
   - SFTP: is an SSH based version of much older ftp protocols that is used to copy files
 - TUI: Text User Interface
 - TMUX: terminal multiplexer
 - ls: list files in current directory

  ## Week 6- Git and Github
  -Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the Linux Kernel after a conflict related to a previous tool
  -Git: open-sourced software tool installed locally on your computer, first released in 2005
-Git: deals with files the files on your disk
-your local git installation communicates with Github (or another git server)
-Github: Commercial service in the cloud launched in 2008 as a startup but currently owned by Microsoft
-Github: provides a place to store work in the cloud and share it with others; lots of extra funciionality on top Github pages, Github Projects
-Cycle with Git: we "clone" the repo first and get a local copy of the repo
- "Pull": the latest version from the remote repo
- Modify files using any editor
-"Commit" your changes to your local repo "commit" as a verb= create version
- "Push" your commit to the remote repo "commit" as a noun is a synonym of "version"
-Repeat
- When you have a git repository, you have an additional directory called .git
